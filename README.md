# Tower of Hanoi

This project was created for a software engineering course _2XA3 - Software Development Skills_. The project implements a simplified variation of the Tower of Hanoi using the NASM assembly language. The purpose of this project was to gain familiarity working with data structures and algorithms in the NASM assembly language, and develop experience with Unix, Bash, and command line tools.
